# My Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio repository! This project serves as the culmination of my individual efforts during the Adalab bootcamp. It was designed to provide a space where I could showcase everything I've learned and demonstrate my projects.

## Technologies Used
1. Astro: I've utilized Astro for this project, which I learned outside of the bootcamp through online resources.

2. TypeScript: TypeScript has been instrumental in handling the logic of my portfolio.

3. Tailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS was used for styling alongside CSS. Both TypeScript and Tailwind have been significant personal discoveries for me, as the little I've learned about them through self-study has been incredibly rewarding.
